    Are you seriously looking for this shit or are you just some ultra-sleazy lawyer thinking they can make a quick
    buck?
    <br />
    If the latter, guess what: you can't get blood from a stone. I'm homeless, I've dedicated my life to publish
    servitude - as you should have, but didn't. Give me a fucking break.
    <br />
    If the former, here's the deal: I store the email provided on both the stripe payment page and the main page in
    Cloudflare workers (KV), along with the twitter link provided, the survey responses, and the emoji. Obviously. Is
    this news to anyone?
    <br />
    Survey data is kept because I may publish the coarse statistics derived from survey data to the world at large.
    Alternatively, I may not.
    <br />
    Everything else is kept because the damn service wouldn't work without it.
    <br />
    Email data is not shared. Emoji data and the link used to verify your account are accessible to the wold at large in
    order for the browser extension to work.
    <br />
    I invoke the reCaptcha service to help validate, this involves collection data about your interaction with the site
    and sharing it with Google, in order to determine if the site is being accessed by a script rather than human
    visitor and refuse to verify accounts if so.
    <br />
    Reach out to me on twitter if you have any further concerns, would like your data deleted, etc.
